# Pleasant Times

## Motivation

As of writing, the COVID-19 situation requires most of us to stay at home.

This means watching a lot of Netflix shows. **A lot.**

Unfortunately, this in turn means browsing through a tsunami of Adam Sandler, Owen Wilson or Kevin Hart movie thumbnails while hoping to find something to watch. 

This is why this Chrome extension filters out some of the lowest-quality content from Netflix, as rated in a completly arbitrary way. Because no one should suffer through _Happy Gilmore_ ever again.
